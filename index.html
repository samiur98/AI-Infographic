            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Crypto Currencies are a collection of digitilized monetary
               entities that have generated a great deal of excitement in 
               the tech community. It is a revolutionary technology that is 
               both frightening and exciting at the same time. It is also a 
               technology that threatens to change our economic infrastructure.
               The question now being whether this change is a positive or a 
               negative. This infographic is not designed to answer this question
               but rather provide some general information to help readers make an 
               informed decision.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Before this infographic dives into the technical mechanics
               of cryptocurrencies, it is important that readers have some 
               knowledge of the history of cryptocurrencies. Although 
               cryptocurrencies have gained prominence fairly recently through
               the success of bitcoin, the invention of cryptocurrencies date 
               back as early as 1983. The invention can be credited to American
               cryptographer David Chaum. However, he technically did not invent 
               a cryptocurrency but the first form of digitilized money. He called it
               ecash. The key breakthrough of Chaum's invention was the fact that it
               enabled untracebale payments. This is also a property that cryptocurrencies
               have inherited. The first decentralized cryptocurrency was invented in 
               2009, by a programmer/s by the pseudoname Satoshi Nakamoto. 
               This cryptocurrency was named BitCoin and the identity of its creator/s 
               remains a mystery to this day. Soon after other cryptocurrencies such as 
               LiteCoin followed. Despite functionaly being the same technology, there are 
               certain differences in the implementation of different cryptocurrencies.
               For example BitCoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm while LiteCoin uses the 
               scrypt hashing algorithm. Despite many competitors BitCoin remains the most 
               popular and valuable cryptocurrency.

            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p> In this section the infographic will try to explain the 
                underlying mechanics of how cryptocurrencies work in a 
                simple and non-jargon fashion. The key question I believe
                that most readers are interested in is how cryptocurrencies
                generate value. There are many complex topics that work under
                the hood such as peer to peer networks, public ledgers/blockchains, 
                and hashing algorithms. The key thing to understand is that 
                cryptocurrencies generate value by rewarding computers/machines 
                for solving computational problems. Unlike traditional fiat money,
                the creation and distribution is not controlled by a centralized 
                authority. Whether this is a positive or a negative is up to the 
                reader to determine. As far as usage is concern, cryptocurrencies are 
                reknown for their security but they require the use of computer technology.
                This may not seem like an issue in first world countries like America and 
                Canada but for now it is something that may not be feasible for the global
                community. This is particularly true for countries and communities that are 
                lacking in terms of finance and technological education.

            <h2>Mining</h2>
            <p>Mining is the process by which users may recieve 
               cryptocurrencies. During the mining processs, a 
               machine/computer attempts to solve a computational/hashing 
               problem. Cryptocurrencies are then rewarded based on the success
               of their machine/computer. Although the premise of mining is simple,
               the process and strtegies involved are quite complex. There are many 
               factors to consider such as the machine being used, the electrical
               consumption and cost of the electrical consumption, and the market value 
               of the cryptocurrency being mined. Readers are advised to do research and/or 
               consult experts before diving into mining cryptocurrencies.
